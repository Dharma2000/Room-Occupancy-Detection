# Room-Occupancy-Detection
The Occupancy Prediction project aims to predict whether a room is occupied or not based on the data collected from various sensors. The dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of 7 attributes, namely date, temperature, humidity, light, CO2, humidity ratio, and occupancy.
